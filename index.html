    <p>Service Fabric I/O is a framework through which a set of distributed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">microservices</a>  are connected in such as way that they resemble a fabric when viewed collectively.
        The service fabric enables <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">microservice</a> Developers Rapidly develop Distributed, Resilient, Scalable, Reactive, Modern applications such as
        on-line gaming and Social. It greatly simplifies and streamlines asynchronous programming and provides a tool-set for managing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">microservices</a> architecture.
        Service Fabric has been designed carefully with the experiences earned over the years from the implementation of many Online Services and platforms.
        As a result, Service Fabric I/O has succeeded to find a way to achieve ease of development, performance, stability, and flexibility
        without a compromise.

    </hr>
    <p>
            The Service Fabric I/O is composed by reusable components that are the foundation for building distributed applications:
        <li><a href="Cluster.html" title="Service Fabric Cluster">Service Fabric Cluster:</a>
            Service Fabric Cluster provides a fault-tolerant decentralized peer-to-peer based cluster membership service with no single point of failure or single point of bottleneck.
            It does this using gossip protocols and an automatic failure detector.
        </li>
        <li><a href="Cluster.html" title="Service Fabric Cluster Transport">Service Fabric Cluster Transport:</a>
            Service Fabric Cluster provides a method to communicate between cluster members and exchange bi-directional communications.
            the cluster communication is based on netty that provides Better throughput and lower latency communication.
        </li>
        <li><a href="Cluster.html" title="Service Fabric Failure Detector">Service Fabric Failure Detector:</a>
            Failure Detector and Cluster Membership are valuable components for system management, replication, load balancing, group communication
            services, various consensus algorithms and other distributed services which rely on reasonably accurate detection of failed members. At scale,
            failure becomes common rather than exceptional; hardware fails, networks become congested, network links fail. Libraries capable of extremely
            high throughput and extremely low latency are meaningless if the systems they run on or communicate with fail. Failure detectors are a central
            component in a fault-tolerant distributed systems running over unreliable asynchronous networks.
        </li>
