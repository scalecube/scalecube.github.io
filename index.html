    <p>The service fabric enables Service Developers Rapidly develop Resilient Scalable applications
        Service Fabric is a framework that enables quick and easy development of modern distributed, resilient, scalable reactive applications such as
        on-line gaming,and Social.
        It greatly simplifies and streamlines distributed asynchronous programming and provides a tool-set for managing micro-services architecture.
        Service Fabric has been designed carefully with the experiences earned from the implementation of many Online Services.
        As a result, Service Fabric I/O has succeeded to find a way to achieve ease of development, performance, stability, and flexibility
        without a compromise.

    </hr>
    <p>
        The service fabric is a set or reusable components modules that provides the foundation for building distributed applications and that includes:
    <li><a href="Cluster.html" title="Service Fabric Cluster">Service Fabric Cluster:</a>
        Service Fabric Cluster provides a fault-tolerant decentralized peer-to-peer based cluster membership service with no single point of failure or single point of bottleneck.
        It does this using gossip protocols and an automatic failure detector.
    </li>
    <li><a href="Cluster.html" title="Service Fabric Cluster Transport">Service Fabric Cluster Transport:</a>
        Service Fabric Cluster provides a method to communicate between cluster members and exchange bi-directional communications.
        the cluster communication is based on netty that provides Better throughput and lower latency communication.
    </li>
    <li><a href="Cluster.html" title="Service Fabric Failure Detector">Service Fabric Failure Detector:</a>
        Failure Detector and Cluster Membership are valuable components for system management, replication, load balancing, group communication
        services, various consensus algorithms and other distributed services which rely on reasonably accurate detection of failed members. At scale,
        failure becomes common rather than exceptional; hardware fails, networks become congested, network links fail. Libraries capable of extremely
        high throughput and extremely low latency are meaningless if the systems they run on or communicate with fail. Failure detectors are a central
        component in a fault-tolerant distributed systems running over unreliable asynchronous networks.
    </li>
