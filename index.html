<p>The service fabric enables Service Developers Rapidly develop Resilient Scalable applications
Service Fabric is a framework that enables quick and easy development of modern distributed, resilient, scalable reactive applications such as 
on-line gaming, 
eTrading and Social. 
It greatly simplifies and streamlines distributed programming and provides a tool-set for managing micro-services architecture.
'Quick and easy' doesn't mean that a resulting application will suffer from a maintainability or a performance issue. Service Fabric has been designed carefully with the experiences earned from the implementation of a lot of Gaming Distributed Services. As a result, Service Fabric IO has succeeded to find a way to achieve ease of development, performance, stability, and flexibility without a compromise.


The service fabric Features:
<!--

-->

-->

	<li> Simple, asynchronous programming model for writing distributed non-blocking services that can scale</li>
	<li>Takes advantage of the JVM and scales over available cores </li>
	<li>Cluster aware and distributed Event Driven SOA</li>
	<li>Technology abstraction with a plug and play model</li>
	<li>Can be embedded in existing Java applications</li>
	<li>Modular, Service is a stand alone deployable unit Service Fabric manages their topology on demand</li>
	<li>Fault tolerance, node can appear or disappear at any given time.</li>
	<li>Includes distributed Service Bus and Event bus</li>
	<li>Zero Conf, Automatic discovery peer-to-peer service discovery using gossip.</li>
	<li>Smart Routing and balancing strategies.</li>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works</h3>

<p>
The service fabric node provision the services dynamically to the cluster so when a service request arrives to any service fabric node it is routed to the provisioning node in a transparent manner.
that means that having service fabric nodes that provision no services makes these nodes transparent proxy and routers to the cluster.
the nodes that do provision business services will serve the business request as they arrive to them but also may act as transparent proxy.

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
