        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
            ScaleCube Cluster provides a fault-tolerant decentralized peer-to-peer based cluster membership service with
            no single point of failure or single point of bottleneck. It does this using gossip protocols and an
            automatic failure detector.
        </p>

        <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>

        <h4>Cluster</h4>

        <p>
            A set of nodes (servers) joined together through the membership protocol.
        </p>

        <h4>Member</h4>

        <p>
            A member is a single node (server) that is part of your cluster. There could be multiple members on a single
            physical machine which running transport on different ports and defined by a member id.
        </p>

        <h4>Transport</h4>

        <p>
            Transport component is responsible to maintain point-to-point connections between the members. It is used as
            a backbone for asynchronous messaging between the members of the cluster.
        </p>

        <h4>Cluster Membership</h4>

        <p>
            Cluster Membership component is responsible for managing information about existing members of the cluster.
            It is running Java implementation of <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asdas/research/dsn02-swim.pdf">SWIM
            protocol</a> for distributed group membership, with a few minor adaptations. It uses suspicion mechanism
            over the failure detector events. Also it uses separate membership updates dissemination component (gossip
            protocol). But it introduces a separate gossip protocol component instead of piggybacking membership updates
            on top of failure detector messages. It is done in order to reuse gossip component for other platform events
            and have more fine grained control over time intervals used for gossiping and failure detection pinging.
            New members to the cluster joins via the configuration provided well known server addresses (seed members).
            And also it extends SWIM protocol with the introduction of periodic SYNC messages in order to improve
            recovery from network partitioning and message losses.
        </p>

        <h4>Seed Members</h4>

        <p>
            The seed members is a set of configured contact points for new members joining the cluster. When a new
            member is started it sends to all seed nodes SYNC message in order to synchronize membership
            tables until one of them answers, if all failed to answer it is decided that this member is the first member
            in the cluster. Seed members will be used further in order to restore cluster from network partitioning.
            They will continued to be SYNCed by cluster members even if they are marked as failed. It is possible to
            configure any node as a seed member in order to join the cluster, but it is recommended to configure nodes
            with most probability for maximum up-time so in such case cluster can be restored from network partitioning
            through SYNC messages with seed members (e.g. API Gateways can serve as a seed members of the cluster).
            The seed nodes can be started in any order and it is not necessary to have all/or any seed nodes running,
            but when initially starting a cluster, the cluster will be initialized only when one or more seed-nodes will
            become initialized else no other node can join the cluster and nodes can only see themselves. Note that you
            can only join to an existing cluster member, which means that for bootstrapping some node must join itself,
            and then the following nodes could join them to make up a cluster.
        </p>

        <h4>Failure Detector</h4>

        <p>
            Failure Detector component is responsible for monitoring availability of other members in the cluster and
            for detecting if a node is unreachable from the rest of the cluster. The nodes in the cluster monitor each
            other using <a href="http://www.antonkharenko.com/2015/08/scalable-and-efficient-distributed.html">random-probing
            based failure detector algorithm</a> with suspicion mechanism. So when any node detects
            the node as unreachable that information will spread to the rest of the cluster through the gossip protocol.
            In other words, only one node needs to mark a node unreachable to have the rest of the cluster mark that
            node unreachable. Node marked as unreachable are not removed until configured timeout. The failure detector
            continue to monitor this node and detect if the node becomes reachable again.
        </p>

        <h4>Gossip Protocol</h4>

        <p>
            Gossip Protocol component responsible for spreading information (gossips) over the cluster members using
            infection-style dissemination algorithms. It provides reliable cross-cluster broadcast.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <h4>Maven Repository</h4>

        <p>
            The ScaleCube Cluster is hosted on Maven Central. In order to use it just add dependency on the latest
            version in your pom.xml file:
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.scalecube&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;scalecube-cluster&lt;artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;0.0.5&lt;version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
        </pre>

        <h4>Join Cluster</h4>

        <p>
            Setting up cluster consisting from two member nodes A and B both running on a same machine, but different
            ports. Member A is a seed node of the cluster. Member B use Member A as seed to join the cluster:
        </p>

	    <pre class="prettyprint">
// Create cluster member A on port 3000 and join a cluster as a seed member
ICluster clusterA = Cluster.newInstance(3000).joinAwait();

// Create cluster member B on port 3001 and join a cluster with the seed member A
String seedMembers = "localhost:3000";
ICluster clusterB =  Cluster.newInstance(3001, seedMembers).join();
        </pre>



        <h4>Spread Gossip through the Cluster</h4>

        <p>Member A listens for the gossips disseminated through the cluster:</p>

	    <pre class="prettyprint">
// Subscribe to all gossip messages:
clusterA.gossip().listen().subscribe(new Action1&lt;Message&gt;() {
    @Override
    public void call(Message gossip) {
        // print out the gossip message
        System.out.println("Gossip message: " + gossip);
    }
});
        </pre>

        <p>Member B spreads gossip message through the cluster:</p>

	    <pre class="prettyprint">
// Spread gossip
cluster.gossip().spread(new Message(new Greetings("Greetings from ClusterMember B")));
        </pre>

        <h4>Send Messages between Cluster Members</h4>

        <p>Member A listens to Greetings messages using filter:</p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
// Filter and subscribe to greetings messages:
clusterA.listen().filter(new Func1&lt;Message, Boolean&gt;() {
    @Override
    public Boolean call(Message message) {
      return message.data() != null && Greetings.class.equals(message.data().getClass());
    }
}).subscribe(new Action1&lt;Message&gt;() {
    @Override
    public void call(Message message) {
        System.out.println(message.data());
    }
});
        </pre>

        <p>Member B sends Greetings message to all other members of the cluster:</p>

	    <pre class="prettyprint">
// Send Greetings message to other cluster members
Greetings greetings = new Greetings("Greetings from ClusterMember B");
Message greetingsMessage = new Message(greetings);
List&lt;ClusterMember&gt; members = clusterB.membership().members();
for (ClusterMember member : members) {
    if (!clusterB.membership().isLocalMember(member)) {
        clusterB.send(member, greetingsMessage);
    }
}
        </pre>
