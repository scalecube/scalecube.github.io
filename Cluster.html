        <h2>Intro</h2>
          <dd>Service Fabric Cluster provides a fault-tolerant decentralized peer-to-peer based cluster membership service with no single point of failure or single point of bottleneck.
            It does this using gossip protocols and an automatic failure detector.</dd>

        <h2>Terms</h2>
        <h4>Cluster Member</h4>
           <dd>A logical member of a cluster. There could be multiple nodes on a physical machine. Defined by a member id.</dd>

         <h4> cluster</h4>
           <dd>A set of nodes joined together through the membership service.</dd>

         <h4>Seed Members</h4>
          <dd>The seed members are configured contact points for new members joining the cluster.
              When a new member is started it sends a message to all seed nodes and then sends a join command to the seed node that answers first.
              The seed members configuration value does not have any influence on the running cluster itself,
              it is only relevant for new members joining the cluster as it helps them to find contact points to send the join command to;
              a new member can send this command to any current member of the cluster, not only to the seed members.
          </dd>
    </p>



    setting up cluster nodes A and B while A is seed node and B use A as seed.
    <pre class=prettyprint><code class=java>
        // create cluster member A on port 3000 and join as seed member
        ICluster clusterA = Cluster.newInstance(3000);
        clusterA.join();

        // create cluster member B on port 3001 and join as seed member A
        ICluster clusterB =  Cluster.newInstance(3001,"localhost:3000");
        clusterB.join();


    </pre>
